# Personal Arch Strike Development Framework
BASH scripts to create the framework and build/test in. Nothing fancy or great, it's just something that works for me.

- [ ] Test for bash
- [ ] Test for aspkg install (bashrc export, conf dir, chroot)
- [ ] Test fail: create environment (add export, conf dir, chroot, optional: git repos)
